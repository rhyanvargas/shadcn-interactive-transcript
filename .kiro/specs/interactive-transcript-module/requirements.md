# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Transcript Module is a composable, flexible, lightweight, and simple React component built with shadcn/ui and Next.js 15. This module leverages web standard APIs like WebVTT to provide users with an interactive way to view, navigate, and interact with transcript content. It's designed to be compatible with web-API friendly media components and maintains high-quality developer experience through best practices, proper TypeScript support, and modular architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a composable transcript component that works with web standard APIs, so that I can easily integrate it with any media component that supports WebVTT.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is imported THEN it SHALL be usable with minimal props
2. WHEN the component is rendered THEN it SHALL accept WebVTT format data and raw text with transformation utilities
3. WHEN the component is used THEN it SHALL be tree-shakable and have minimal bundle impact
4. WHEN the component is integrated THEN it SHALL follow shadcn/ui design patterns and conventions
5. WHEN used with media components THEN it SHALL be compatible with web-API friendly libraries like next-video

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view transcript content in a readable format, so that I can easily follow along with audio or video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcript data is provided THEN the component SHALL display text segments with timestamps
2. WHEN viewing the transcript THEN text SHALL be properly formatted and readable
3. WHEN the transcript is long THEN it SHALL handle scrolling efficiently
4. WHEN segments have speakers THEN they SHALL be visually distinguished

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through the transcript by clicking on segments, so that I can jump to specific parts of the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transcript segment is clicked THEN it SHALL trigger a callback with the timestamp
2. WHEN a segment is active/current THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted
3. WHEN navigating segments THEN the component SHALL provide smooth visual feedback
4. WHEN segments are interactive THEN they SHALL have proper hover and focus states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through the transcript content, so that I can quickly find specific topics or keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search functionality is enabled THEN it SHALL provide a search input
2. WHEN searching for text THEN matching segments SHALL be highlighted
3. WHEN search results are found THEN the component SHALL allow navigation between matches
4. WHEN no results are found THEN it SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible styling and theming options, so that the component matches my application's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the component THEN it SHALL support shadcn/ui theme variables
2. WHEN customizing appearance THEN it SHALL accept custom CSS classes
3. WHEN theming THEN it SHALL support both light and dark modes
4. WHEN styling THEN it SHALL provide CSS custom properties for fine-tuning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript support, so that I have excellent developer experience with type safety and IntelliSense.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the component THEN it SHALL provide full TypeScript definitions
2. WHEN passing props THEN they SHALL be strictly typed with helpful JSDoc comments
3. WHEN using callbacks THEN they SHALL have proper type inference
4. WHEN importing THEN it SHALL support proper tree-shaking with TypeScript

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to be performant and lightweight, so that it doesn't negatively impact my application's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering large transcripts THEN it SHALL use virtualization or efficient rendering strategies
2. WHEN the component updates THEN it SHALL minimize unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN bundled THEN it SHALL have a minimal footprint with no unnecessary dependencies
4. WHEN used THEN it SHALL follow React performance best practices

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebVTT API integration and transformation utilities, so that I can work with standard web media APIs and various transcript formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing raw text THEN the component SHALL offer transformation functions to convert to WebVTT tracks and cues
2. WHEN working with media elements THEN it SHALL integrate with standard media events through WebVTT API
3. WHEN using with video or audio THEN it SHALL support both media types through web standard APIs
4. WHEN integrating with media libraries THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with components like next-video

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to implement and customize the component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear API documentation
2. WHEN learning to use the component THEN it SHALL include practical examples with next-video integration
3. WHEN customizing THEN it SHALL provide theming and styling guides
4. WHEN working with WebVTT THEN it SHALL include transformation utility examples and media integration patterns
